refactoring assignment
**** Note to Grader ... I think I messed up on how i saved and uploaded this assignment. When I was editing it I did it as if I was going to push back to the main repo instead of cloning it and saving as a seperate repo and now im having a lot of issues with broken image links and so on... please have mercy as I cannot figure out what happened... Thank you for your patience with this assignment.
